"Homework" and alternative examples from the fastai courses, Deep Learning 1 &amp; 2

If you've been at all curioius about the field of deep learning you should really take 
a look at the work being done by Jeremy Howard, Rachel Thomas, and various helpers at 
Fastai. Their online course is an approachable, interesting, surprisingly simple 
introduction to a fascinating subject.

The <a href= https://course.fast.ai/>course lessons</a> are obviously the most sensible place to begin.

And, you should definitely visit the <a href= https://forums.fast.ai/>Discussion Forums</a>.

These are simply a collection of my own notes from moving through the course along with 
alternative examples that I hope demonstrate some other possibilities.
